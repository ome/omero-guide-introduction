Search for Data
===============

In this section, we present the server-wide search in OMERO. This is an additional option for data management, which complements filtering, mining and using annotations to organize your data, which are described elsewhere in :doc:`annotate`.

Description
-----------

We will show:

-  How to start a search in OMERO.web.

-  How to search for objects annotated with a specific Key-Value Pair.

-  How to use Advanced Search.

   -  How to search for terms in specific fields e.g. "name".

   -  How to combine search terms using AND.

   -  How to combine search terms using AND NOT.

Resources
---------

-  Documentation:

   -  `Search <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/latest/developers/Modules/Search.html>`_


Setup
-----

-  The data used are from the `siRNAi-HeLa <https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/images/DV/siRNAi-HeLa>`_ folder.

-  The Key-Value Pairs were added to the images in the siRNAi-HeLa Dataset for all users using the script `key_value_pairs.py <https://github.com/ome/training-scripts/blob/master/maintenance/scripts/key_value_pairs.py>`_.

Step-by-Step
------------

#.  Open a browser and enter the provided URL

#.  Connect using the provided credentials

#.  Enter ``mitomycin-A`` into the search box in the top right corner of the webclient |image1|

#.  Press ``Enter``.

#.  The search results will show any objects e.g. Images or Datasets, which have anywhere the string mitomycin-A.

#.  Several images should be found, from two different datasets.

#.  Refine the search now for only Key-Value Pairs which have the key ``mitomycin-A`` and value ``0mM`` by entering ``mitomycin-A:0mM`` into the search box and pressing ``Enter``.

#.  Now you should find only 21 images.

#.  Click on the ``Advanced search`` tab in the search results.

#. Enter ``mitomycin-A:0mM AND name:VRAQ`` which will narrow down your previous search for ``mitomycin-A:0mM`` to objects which also have ``VRAQ`` in their name.

#. You should see 5 results now.

#. Enter ``mitomycin-A:0mM AND NOT name:VRAQ`` which will reject all objects which have ``VRAQ`` in their name and find only the ones which are named differently.

#. You should see 16 results now.

#. Click on the Browse link |image2|\ in one search result line of the last image (in the right-hand part of the centre pane) to navigate back to the main webclient.
